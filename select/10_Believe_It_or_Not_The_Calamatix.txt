Believe it or not
I won't make the same mistakes
Believe it or not
I won't play the fool again
Believe it or not
Imma get up out my way
Believe it or not
It's a whole brand new day
I write stories
Don't send 'em
Full paragraphs
You won't see them I write letters
Just to myself
They were for you
You won't read them
You don't reply
When I do
It's breaks my heart
It's black and blue
You don't care anymore
What's the use
And that tears me apart
No excuse

Believe it or not
I won't make the same mistakes
Believe it or not
I won't play the fool again
Believe it or not
Imma get up out my way
Believe it or not
It's a whole brand new day
I smoke it down In the sun
These shadows
Overrun
It isn't fair
No it isn't fun
I can't stop thinkin'
You're the one
But that's a story
For another day
I gotta get up Get out my way
This heartbreak
It won't defeat me I'm gonna stay up
'Cause I'm smokin' trees

Believe it or not
I won't make the same mistakes
Believe it or not
I won't play the fool again
Believe it or not
Imma get up out my way
Believe it or not
It's a whole brand new day
