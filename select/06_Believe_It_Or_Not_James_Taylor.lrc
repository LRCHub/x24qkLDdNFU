[00:07.50] Believe it or not
[00:09.18] I've been waiting for you to come through
[00:16.74] Love of my life
[00:19.76] Believe it or not
[00:21.77] I've been waiting for you to come through
[00:29.11] Love of my life
[00:36.61] 
[00:33.10] And though the hour grew later and later
[00:40.44] I would hold on for one more heartbeat
[00:48.13] While my friends around me were calling
[00:54.58] "Today, today, today, today"
[01:08.58] 
[01:01.82] As strange as it seems
[01:03.83] I remember your face from before
[01:11.25] Believe it or not
[01:14.54] Before you and I were washed up
[01:18.30] On this alien shore
[01:23.90] As strange as that seems
[01:35.90] 
[01:27.59] Though the hour grew later and later
[01:36.27] Still I'd hold on for one more heartbeat
[01:44.26] While my friends around me were calling
[01:50.24] "Today, today, today, today"
[02:04.24] 
[01:57.94] Today the world seems brighter
[02:03.84] Light and bright and right somehow
[02:10.33] I could not have held on tighter
[02:16.67] Waiting for the past to come to pass, no
[02:36.67] 
[02:29.39] Once in a dream I've seen myself through your eyes
[02:38.31] This you should know
[02:41.95] Wading the stream that flows in between you and I
[02:51.70] Once in a dream
[02:59.20] 
[02:55.67] And though the hour grows later and later
[03:04.36] I would hold on for one more heartbeat
[03:12.47] While my friends around me were calling
[03:18.78] "Today, today, today, today"
